        <p>
          Currently, I am a Software Development student, with this I can
          confidently claim that I know a variety of programming languages and
          technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Unreal Engine
          Blueprint. My experiences in software development include practical
          responsibilities and management with passion on development of
          projects. Altogether, over the years, I have focused not only on the
          improvement of the technical knowledge but also on the abilities to
          manage projects and teams. Coordinating and working with people at all
          levels of the organization has been very informative in terms of
          communication, decision making, and management. These have made me
          versatile and flexible person who is has the capacity to competently
          handle the challenges that come with management of software
          development projects right from design to delivery. Outside education,
          soccer and gaming are my areas of interest and hobbies which are fun
          and innovative forms of recreation. From these hobbies, one gets to
          learn on some aspects like teamwork, strategic planning and how to
          balance time. Also, I cherish the opportunities to help people, for
          example, if I face classmates with coding issues or when I guide
          junior developers. I look forward towards the future and I always look
          forward to learning new things and be a constant growth in software
          development. The career objective of the candidate is to utilize his
          or her talents and abilities to be of value to outstanding ventures
          and groups while continually advancing the possibilities through
          technology.
